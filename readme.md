# Haskell Open RTB implementation

## installation
this codebase uses snap-server / snap-core 1.0, which are not yet on hackage
so you'll need to run `./new-snap-deps.sh` to install them for now

only implements the openRTB 2.2 spec

currently work in progress, please contact me if youre using it seriously :)
